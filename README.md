🎯 Arrow Tune Calculator

A simple arrow-tuning tool for archers

Arrow Tune Calculator is a lightweight, browser-based tool that helps archers calculate important arrow characteristics such as total arrow weight, FOC (Front of Center), grains per pound, and grains per inch. The tool works completely locally in your browser — no installs, no accounts, no tracking — and is easy to modify for future features.

✅ Features

- Instant live calculations while you type
- FOC (Front of Center) with visual indicator
- Total arrow weight (grains)
- Grains per Pound (GPP)
- Grains per Inch (shaft & full arrow)
- Weight distribution bar (shaft / point system / fletching)
- Clean, mobile-friendly layout
- Works on iOS, Android, and desktop browsers
- Can be installed as a Home-Screen App on mobile devices

Future Improvements (optional ideas)

✅ TODO List — Arrow Tune Calculator
Phase 1 — Core Enhancements
Code & Structure

 - Add author and maintainer info
 - Add inline documentation for calculations and UI sections
 Add date/version to the UI

UI/UX Improvements

 - Add arrow name field (e.g., “Easton Axis 5.0 250 Spine”)
 - Add arrow spine field (250, 300, 350, etc.)
 - Add user notes field
 - Add hover tooltips explaining each input field

Core Calculations

 - Add momentum calculation

 Add Feet Per Second (FPS):

 - FPS at launch
 - FPS at 30 yards (editable)
 - FPS at 60 yards (editable)

Phase 2 — Data Saving & Power Features
Local Storage & Shooter Profiles

 - Save arrow builds locally
 - Support multiple saved arrow builds
 - Support multiple shooters (per shooter profiles)
 - Export saved data to .csv

Phase 3 — Advanced Visualizations
Visual Tools

 - Add enhanced arrow weight distribution visualization
 - Left = nock end
 - Right = point end
 - Show FOC shift (balance point vs geometric center)
 - Add FPS drop visualization over distance
 - Add arrow trajectory graph
 - User sets max yardage (0–100 yards)
 - Show max height of arc in feet
 - Add projected kill-effectiveness visualization
 - Based on momentum/energy
 - Color-coded zones from 0 to 80 yards

Phase 4 — Long-Term / Expert Features

 - Add dynamic spine estimation
 - Add side-by-side arrow comparison mode
 - Add environmental adjustments (wind, temp, bow efficiency)
 - Convert to PWA (offline support, installable app)
 - Add JSON import/export for arrow builds
 - Compare two arrows side-by-side
 - Add color themes (light/dark mode)
 - Store presets using localStorage
 - Package as a full mobile app
