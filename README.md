# 🎯 Arrow Tune Calculator  
**Offline • Fast • Mobile-Friendly Bow & Arrow Tuning Tool**

https://dmarcus-wire.github.io/arrow-tune-calculator/ 

The **Arrow Tune Calculator** is an all-in-one bowhunting and archery performance tool designed to help archers build, tune, and analyze arrow setups with clarity — entirely offline.

Whether you're experimenting with point weights, arrow components, FOC, trajectory, or kinetic energy, this calculator provides instant, accurate results through live calculations and clean, intuitive visuals.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔧 Bow & Arrow Setup
- Enter full bow specs: **IBO/ATA rating**, **draw weight**, **draw length**, **string components**, and more.  
- Choose **Simple** or **Advanced** modes for arrow weight input.  
- Smart **build name auto-suggestion** for organizing setups.

---

### 📐 Arrow Efficiency Metrics
- **FPS (launch speed)** — estimated from bow specs or manually entered  
- **GPP** (grains per pound)  
- **GPI** (grains per inch)  
- **TW** (Total Weight)  
- **FOC** with a compact visual bar  
- **Arrow Weight Composition** (shaft vs point vs components)

All metrics use unified colors and centered card layouts for readability.

---

### 🎯 Performance at Distance
Dynamic arrow behavior at any distance (0–120 yards):

- **Velocity @ distance**
- **Peak flight height** (calculated using projectile physics)
- **Launch & Impact KE**
- **Impact Momentum**
- **Time to Impact**

Set a distance with the slider and all metrics update instantly.

---

### 🦌 Game Effectiveness (Impact-Based)
Instant classification of ethical shot potential using KE and momentum:

- Small / Thin-skinned  
- Medium Game  
- Large / Tough  
- Dangerous / Extreme  

Each category displays **Send it** (green) or **Don’t** (red) based on widely-used KE & momentum thresholds.

## 🧮 How Calculations Work

### Launch Speed (FPS)
Estimated using:
- IBO/ATA rating  
- Draw weight  
- Draw length  
- Total arrow weight  
- String accessory weight  

You may override this with **chronograph FPS** for maximum accuracy.

### Peak Height Formula
Uses closed-form projectile motion equations:

- Computes true apex height of the arrow *before* reaching the target  
- Useful for treestand shooting, blinds, windows, and shooting lanes
