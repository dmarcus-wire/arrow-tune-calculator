A fast, completely offline, browser-based tuning tool for compound and recurve archers.

## Current Features (v1.0.2 – Nov 2025)

- Live calculations as you type  
- Front-of-Center (FOC %) with visual balance-point gauge  
- Total arrow weight (grains)  
- Grains Per Pound (GPP)  
- Grains Per Inch (full arrow & shaft-only GPI)  
- Weight distribution breakdown (shaft | point system | nock/vanes/wrap)  
- Clean, mobile-first design  
- Fully functional offline (PWA-ready)  

## Coming Soon – Roadmap

| Phase | Features | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Arrow name & spine fields • Glue weight estimate • Momentum • FPS estimator (muzzle + downrange) • Tooltips & inline help | In active development |
| Phase 2 | Local save/load builds • Multiple arrow profiles • CSV export • Printable summary table | Next |
| Phase 3 | FPS drop curve • Interactive trajectory arc (0–100 yd) • Kinetic energy & momentum bands • Kill-effectiveness zones (small → dangerous game) | Planned |

## Quick Start

Just open the link:

Or bookmark it and “Add to Home Screen” on your phone for instant access at the range.

## Why This Tool Exists

Most arrow calculators are either spreadsheets, hand written notes, bloated web apps that track you or paid desktop software. This one is intentionally lightweight, privacy-first, and built to work even when you have no signal at the range.

## Contributing
